Key Findings
------------

1. Weather Response Differences
   - VT/VF: Particularly sensitive to humidity (p < 0.001)

   - Both conditions: Decreased incidence during extreme heat (≥30°C)
   - VT/VF/AMI ratio: Consistent 1.22-1.25 across all temperature ranges
   - Response pattern: Similar temperature response patterns

3. High Incidence Day Overlap
   - Overlap rate: 99.6% (extremely high)
   - Statistical significance: p < 0.001 (strongly associated)
   - Over 3 times the expected overlap

4. Feature Importance (SHAP values)
   - Humidity: 6% more important for VT/VF than AMI
   - Wind speed: 18% more important for AMI than VT/VF
   - Temperature/Pressure: Nearly equal importance
